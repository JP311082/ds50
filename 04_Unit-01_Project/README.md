## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.
