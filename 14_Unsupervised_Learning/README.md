## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part One: Clustering

- Determine the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Demonstrate how to apply k-means clustering.
- Demonstrate how to apply density-based clustering (DBSCAN).
- Demonstrate how to apply hierarchial clustering.


### Part Two: Principle Component Analysis

- Exploring dimensionality reduction and principle component analysis, and applying it to a dataset.
